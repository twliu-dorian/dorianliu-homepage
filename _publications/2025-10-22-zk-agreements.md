**Abstract**

Digital transactions currently exceed trillions of dollars annually, yet traditional paper-based agreements remain a bottleneck for automation, enforceability, and dispute resolution. Computable legal contracts — expressed in machine-readable formats — promise automated execution and verifiable compliance, but current blockchain solutions risk leaking confidential terms.

**zk-Agreements** introduce a privacy-preserving protocol that transitions from paper-based trust to cryptographic trust while maintaining confidentiality. Our design combines zero-knowledge proofs to protect private agreement terms, secure two-party computation for compliance evaluation, and smart contracts for verifiable enforcement. Together, these components achieve both privacy preservation and computational enforceability, resolving the fundamental tension between transparency and confidentiality in blockchain-based agreements.
